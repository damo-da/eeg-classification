# Classification of EEG Motor Imagery and Mental Arithematic Activities using Signal Processing and Machine Learning Techniques
This GitHub repository is part of my Honors Thesis where I study machine learning and signal processing techniques that can be used to study brain wave patterns in the brain during motor imagery (visualization) and mental arithmetic activities. 

The thesis paper is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wmj0AK_YWQXxhFy3ZVJcJoDzDJEv7CC9YbviOUlNpzk/edit).
